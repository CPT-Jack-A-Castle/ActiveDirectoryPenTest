**Using BloodHound in Windows PenTesting**

This is how to gain Active Directory information from a Linux Machine without having a compromised Windows machine.

Follow the instruction on this site to install BloodHound on Kali Linux:
https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/linux.html 

Use the instructions on this site to install bloodhound-python
https://github.com/fox-it/BloodHound.py

Once installed a Warning will appear stating that blood-python is installed on 'home/kali/.local/bin' and that the directory is not stored to $PATH

Let's add it to $PATH
1. Run 'sudo nano ~/.zshrc'
2. At the bottom of the file add: export PATH="$PATH:/home/kali/.local/bin"
3. Save file
4. Run 'source ~/.zshrc'

Edit the /etc/resolv.conf to establish your DNS server as the Domain Controller you are attacking
1. Run 'sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf'
2. In the file change the nameserver to the Domain Controllers IP address
3. Save

Now we can use bloodhound-python to gather information on the domain with the credentials we found using the following command:
'bloodhound-python -u [username] -p [password] -dc [domain controller] --disable-autogc -d [domain]'
'bloodhound-python -u duser -p 'sup3rstr0ngP@ssw0rd' -dc dc1.abc.com --disable-autogc -d abc.com'

The output will be all the information that bloodhound-python gather on the domain
It will also output json files that contain more detailed information

Now we can open BloodHound using the ./BloodHound command
May require execute permissions, use: 'sudo chmod +x ./BloodHound'

You will be prompted to create a new password on the Neo4J localhost page.

With BloodHound open Upload all the JSON files bloodhound-python created

Now you can view several graphs laying out the Active Directory environment
